Delaunay Tessellator 🎨✨

This project leverages Delaunay triangulation to transform your images into stunning low-poly artwork! By intelligently sampling key points—often based on image features like edges and color gradients—it creates a dynamic network of triangles that reimagines your original image in a beautiful, abstract style.

Key Features:

Efficient Point Sampling 📍: Automatically identifies important image features to generate a meaningful set of vertices.
Robust Triangulation 🔺: Utilizes Delaunay’s principle to produce an optimal tessellation that ensures high-quality triangular meshes.
Customizable Aesthetics 🎛️: Offers adjustable parameters like point density and color interpolation, letting you tailor the output to your artistic vision.
Versatile Applications 🖼️: Perfect for graphic designers, digital artists, or anyone looking to experiment with innovative image processing techniques.
Whether you're aiming to create eye-catching art, explore computational geometry, or just have fun with your photos, this project offers a fresh and visually engaging way to reimagine your images!
